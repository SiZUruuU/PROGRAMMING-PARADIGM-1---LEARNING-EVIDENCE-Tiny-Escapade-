General Code Logic and Syntax:
  Ryisnow - His "How to make a 2D game in Java" YouTube Series greatly contributed to how the game was created. (Estimated 70% of the entire code is based off of his)

Flow of the Game:

1st Stage (Console State): User will encounter the console stage where the user must input a string to continue. Inputting 'y' or 'Y' will move the user forward into the game while inputting any other text will 
close the code entirely.

2nd Stage (Title Screen): User will now encounter the title screen. The title screen contains 3 options. Pressing W and S will allow the user to navigate the options. "Start" will move the user to the Guide State, 
"Load" will load the previous save file (If user plays the game for the first time, load file may contain data so it is adviced to press "Start" first). "Quit" will close the code entirely.

3rd Stage (Guide Screen): User will now encounter the guide screen which shows the guide for user controls and stamina mechanic. 
Each page will take approximately 3 seconds before user can move on to the next page (Press Enter).

4th Stage (Play State): Once game is loaded. Player will spawn. 
General Tasks for 4th Stage:
  1st -> Collect at least 30 orbs
  2nd -> Collect 3 keys (User needs 3 orbs to collect keys and keys can be used to unlock a door)
  3rd -> Kill at least 10 ghosts

User can talk to the NPC in the middle. If one or more conditions are not met, NPC dialogue will say a dialogue specific for the condition. Once conditions are all met, NPC will drop a key which allows
user to open the last door. User can then talk to the NPC which moves the player to the 5th Stage.

5th stage (Final Stage): 50 ghosts will now spawn around the map and User must kill at least 50 to win. Once User reaches 50 kills, user is moved to 6th Stage.

6th Stage (Win State0: User will now encounter a victory screen that says "TRIAL IS NOW COMPLETE". User can also go back to title state to replay the game.

Plot of the Game:
(This backstory takes place 500 years before the main story)

-After the Holem Bay attack, Ren was one of the few survivors of the altercation. Injured greatly, he clinged onto life as he ventured for a place to stay and heal. He eventually stumbles upon a family living 
in the outskirts of Cahtlacun. He seeks refuge inside the household and stays for 3 weeks. After that time, he sets out to become stronger. He encounters an abandoned dungeon that is oozing with anomaly
energy. He steps inside and encounters a man in the entrance. Loron, a war veteran from Eski, was sitting in the corner. He says that the dungeon holds the power that might turn the world upside down but no one 
is capable of even venturing the place. Ren takes on the challenge and clears the dungeon for 5 years. He eventually gains the "Soul Affinity" which grants him the power to interact with the soul of any creature. 
Also granting him the 3 Executioner Swords. Arieta, The Sword for One. Mussen, The Sword for Others. Dragonov, the Sword for None. With his newly found ability, he ventures further and hones his technique and 
control, eventually generating powers that not even 10 Kings can handle. He single-handedly took care of the Rebellion and became the first Supreme King worldwide.
